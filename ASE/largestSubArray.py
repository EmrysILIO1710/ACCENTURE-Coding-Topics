# Largest Sub Array

# Given an array containing only 0â€™s and 1â€™s, Find the largest subarray containing an equal number of 0s and 1s.

# Input specification:
# Input 1: The length of an array.
# Input 2: Array containing 0s and 1s.

# Output Specification:
# Return the length of the largest sub-array containing equal no. of 0s and 1s.

# Example 1:
# Input 1: 4
# Input 2: {1,1,0,1}

# Output: 2
# Explanation:
# The largest possible array here would be of length 2 as there should be an equal number of 0 and 1 in it. 
# The starting index and ending index of the largest subarray is 1 and 2. Hence the output is 2.

# Example 2:
# Input 1: 5
# Input 2: {1,1,1,1,1}

# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# In the above example, there are no 0s in the array. Hence the output is 0.
